      This question is asked in <strong>Acts 2:37</strong> and Peter, a disaple of Jesus replies with the following words
      <a id="verse">"Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ
          for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
      </a>
      In <strong id="verse-number">Acts 16:30</strong> This question is asked again where Paul responds with theses words,
          
            <a id="verse" >“Believe in the Lord Jesus,
              and you will be saved, you and your household.” </a>
          
         Before Jesus started His minestry He was baptized in order to <a id="verse">furfill all rightousness </a> <strong>[Matt 3:13-16]</strong>.
        And Jesus began His minestry by saying,
         
        <a id="verse">“ Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."</a> And He later, says that<a id="verse"> whoever 
          believes in Him will have eternal life.</a> (<strong>John 3:16</strong>.) And
        
        What is <a id="link" href="#repentance">repentance?</a> What does it mean to <a id="link" href="#believe">believe?</a> 
         And What is the importance of <a id="link" href="#baptisim">baptisim?</a> Lets unpack these verses. 
        </p>
        </div>
    
      <h4 id="simple-list-item-2" class=" Question">What Does It Mean To Be Saved?</h4>
      <div class="saved-text">
      <p>
          The scripture says <a id="verse">everyone has sinned and fallen short of the glory of God</a> <strong id="verse-number"> (Romans 3:23)</strong>. This means everyone 
         has broken God's law. Sin seperates us from God in this life and the next. And God being rightousness and Holy must judge everyone. This occurs after death where everyone will give an account for every word, thought, 
         and deed in their lifetime <strong id="verse-number">(Hebrews 9:27)</strong>. Unless you have let a perfect 
         life you will not be able to enter the kingdom of God. This is where Jesus enters the picture. 
         In <strong id="verse-number">John 14:6</strong> Jesus says, <a id="verse">"I am the way the truth and the life.  No one comes to the Father except though Me."</a> Jesus,
          the lamb of God <strong>(John 1:29)</strong>. lived a perfect sinless life. He then took upon Himself 
         all the sin and inquity of the world and recived the punishement you deserved. He took your 
         place so that through Him you can be made right with God. The scriptures say... <br/><br>
         
         
         
         
         
         <a id="verse">"But he was pierced for our transgressions;
          he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his wounds we are healed. 
          .... the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all." 
 </a> 





         <br/><br/>
         Though Jesus we recieve salvation.
         God the Son came to the world and <a id="verse">gave His life as a ransom, so that we may be made right with God</a> (<strong id=""verse-number> 
          Mark 10:45</strong>). For our sake <a id="verse">
          He beacame sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God 
        </a> (<strong> 2Co 5:21</strong>). And through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ we have been santified (<strong>Hebrews 10:10</strong> ).
         <br/><br/>
         So What does it actually mean to be saved? When you are saved you are reciving the sacrafice that Jesus made at the cross for you. Through the sacrafice of Jesus, God forgives all your sin.
         Jesus says, <a id="verse">"everyone who sins is a slave to sin."</a> and through His sacrafice, <a> He sets you free. You're given eternal life, made right with God, 
        and The rightousness of Jesus is counted as your own.</a>
        <br/><br/>
        Through Christ Jesus we enter into a covenant with God, which Jesus establishes in Matthew 26:27-28.


        <a id="verse">"And He(Jesus) took a cup, and when He had given thanks He gave it to them, saying, “Drink of it, all of you,for this is my blood of the new 
          covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins."</a> 

        Which was prophesied about in in the Old Testiment ...
        
         <br/><br/>
        <a id="verse">“But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days,” says the Lord, 
          “I will put My law within them, and I will write it on their hearts; and I will be their God, 
          and they will be My people. And each man will no longer teach his neighbor and his brother, saying, 
          ‘Know the Lord,’ for they will all know Me [through personal experience], from the least of them to the greatest,” says the Lord. 
         “For I will forgive their wickedness, and I will no longer remember their sin.”</a> 
         <br/><br/>
          Through the blood of Jesus you enter into this new covnent where you can be close to God. God makes us a <a id="verse">new creation</a> (2Co 5:17)
          He writes His laws on our hearts and puts His Spirit within us. <a id="verse">And all who receive Jesus, who believe in His name, 
            are given the right to become children of God </a>(john 1:12)

      <h4  id="repentance" class="Question">What Is Repentance</h4>
      <div class="saved-text">
      <p > The bible says, <a id="verse">"For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation
         without regret, whereas worldly grief produces death."</a> (<strong>2Cor 7:10</strong> ) This verse shows that simply feeing sorry 
         for your sins or having grief isn't repentance. True repentance means turning from your sin and turning to God.
          When someone repents. They are making the choice to change, to sin no more and live according to the Word of God.  
         and through Jesus you can have freedom from sin. You must decide 
          to humble yourself before God and turn from sin. As Jesus says in the scripture that
          <a id="verse">Unless we repent we will perish </a> (<strong>Luke 13:3</strong>). Like Jesus said to the women caught in adultry, 
          <a id="verse">"go, and from now on sin no more.” </a>(<strong>John 8:11</strong> )  


      </p>
    </div>
      <h4 id="baptisim" class=" Question">What Is The Importance Of Baptisim?</h4>
      <div class="saved-text">
      <p >
      scripture is clear the <a id="verse">"blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin"</a> (1 John 1:7). And when we choose to repent and believe in Christ 
      <a id="verse">If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to 
        forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness </a>"(<strong> 1 John 1:9</strong>.) From scripture we see baptisim does not jusfiy you in the sight fo God, but rather 
      you can only be made right through Jesus. This is illustrated when Jesus is at the cross...
      <br/><br/>
       <a id="verse">"There were also two others, 
        criminals, led with Him to be put to death. And when they had come to the place called Calvary, 
        there they crucified Him, and the criminals, one on the 
        right hand and the other on the left...Then one of the criminals who were hanged blasphemed Him, saying, 
        “If You are the Christ, save Yourself and us." But the
         other, answering, rebuked him, saying, “Do you not even fear God,
         seeing you are under the same condemnation? And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds; but this Man has done nothing wrong."
         Then he said to Jesus, “Lord, 
         remember me when You come into Your kingdom.” And Jesus said to him, “Assuredly, I say to you, today you will be with Me in Paradise."</a>
       <br/><br/>
       this criminal was never baptized, but rather he 
       humbled himself before God. He saw that he was deseving of death. His heart was grived 
       to see God the Son sinless and perfect to be crucified. In this moment you see this man's heart turn 
       from his sin to Jesus Christ. 
       Jesus specifies <a>we enter into the new covnent through His blood not water baptisim.</a>
       And in the scriptures we see <a>water baptisim is not required 
        to recieve the baptism of the Holy Spirit</a> when peter is preaching and....
       <br/><br/>
       <a id="verse">"
       the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the word.
        And the believers from among the circumcised who 
        had come with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit 
        was poured out even on the Gentiles. 
        For they were hearing them speaking in tongues and extolling God. 
        Then Peter declared, “Can anyone withhold water for baptizing these people, 
        who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?” 
        And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of
        Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to remain for some days."(Acts 10:44-48)
        </a>
       <br/><br/>
       Here peter is preaching the gospel and the Holy Spirt falls on men who have not been baptized.

       So, What's the importance and role of baptisim? <a id="highlight"> Baptisim is a death of the old and resurrection into a new life.</a>  When you are are baptized you are 
       uniting yourself with Christ in death, dying to the flesh (your sinful-nature) 
       and being raised into  resurrection with Christ. Paul writes...
       <br/><br/>
        <a id = "verse">"all of us who have been baptized
       into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were buried therefore with him by 
       baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory 
       of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life. For if we have been 
       united with him in a death like his, 
       we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his.We know that our old self was 
       crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, 
       so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin. 
       For one who has died has been set free from sin. Now if we have died with Christ, 
       we believe that we will also live with him. We know that Christ, 
       being raised from the dead, will never die again; 
       death no longer has dominion over him. For the death he
        died he died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God. 
       So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and 
       alive to God in Christ Jesus."</a> <br/><br/>Therefore, when you are baptized 
       you are making the commitment to follow Christ jesus, to die to your sinful 
       nature, the passions of the flesh, and desires of this world. To be raised into new life and to 
       live your life in obidence to the Word of God. Paul continues with these words...
       <br/>
       
       <br/>

       <Do id="verse">"
        thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become 
        obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed, 
        and, having been set free from sin, have become slaves of righteousness. 
        ... 
        For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to
         lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification.
       
       ... now that you have been set 
       free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification
        and its end, eternal life. For the wages of sin is death, but the free 
        gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."
       </a>

    </div>
      
      <h4 id="believe title" class="Question" >What does it mean to believe?</h4>
      <div class="saved-text">
      <p >A very common Bible verse says, <a id="verse">"For God so loved the world, 
        that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes 
        in him should not perish but have eternal life."</a>(<strong>John 3:16</strong> ). And another scripture says,
        <a id="verse">"You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons 
          believe and shudder! Do you want to be shown, you foolish person, 
          that faith apart from works is useless?"</a> (<strong>James 2:19-20</strong> )<br/><br/>
      Jesus says, <a id="verse">“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter 
        the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is 
        in heaven... many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy 
        in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your
         name?’ And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, 
         you workers of lawlessness.’"</a> <br/><br/> 
         In the following scriptures we can see that 
       even people who claim to be believers in Jesus Christ don't inherit eternal life (are not saved).
        So, What does this mean? It means believing is much deeper than
         knowledge or persuation of the truth. True Belief is active. Believing means doing 
         the will of God, being obedient to God's word and following His commands.
         <br/><br/>
         And the greatest command is... <a id="verse">“You shall love the Lord your 
          God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.</a id="verse"> (<strong>Matt 22:37</strong>) 
          What does it mean to love God? Jesus says, <a id="verse">“If anyone loves me, he will keep my word, 
            and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him. 
            Whoever does not love me does not keep my words."</a>

  </div>

      <h4 id="sin?"class="Question">What Does The Bible Consider Sin?</h4>
      <div class="saved-text">
      <p >
        There's a lot of confusion on what God considers sin, so What does Jesus say is sinful? 
        Another way of putting this is, what defiles us in the sight of God?

        "There is nothing outside a person that by going into him can defile him,
         but the things that come out of a person are what defile him...
         Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile him,
         since it enters not his heart but his stomach, 
         and is expelled?” (Thus he declared all foods clean.)
         And he said, “What comes out of a person is what defiles him.
         For from within, out of the heart of man,
          come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery,
          coveting, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride, foolishness.
          All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person."

           Here Jesus says that nothing outside a person can defile someone, for example food and clothing .
           Insted, what defiles someone (makes someone unclean) are the things which 
           orginate in the heart. In Acts 15 the apostles encounter a similar question. Wheater or not new belivers have to keep the laws in the Old Testiment in 
           order to inherit eternal life...           <br/><br/>

           "But some men came down from Judea and were teaching the brothers,
            “Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.” 
            And after Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and debate with them, Paul and Barnabas and some 
           of the others were appointed to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and the elders about this question. 
           ... When they came 
           to Jerusalem, ... some believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees rose up and said, 
           “It is necessary to circumcise them and to order them to keep the law of Moses.”

            The apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider this matter. 
            And after there had been much debate, Peter stood up and said to them, 
            “Brothers, you know that in the early days God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the
             Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe. And God, who knows the heart, 
             bore witness to them, by giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us, and he made no distinction between us and them, 
             having cleansed their hearts by faith. Now, therefore, why are you putting God to the test by placing 
             a yoke on the neck of the disciples that neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear? 
             
             But we believe that we will be saved through the grace [God's mercies demonstrated through the work] of the Lord Jesus, just as they will.”


           ...
           Therefore my judgment is that we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who turn to God, but should write to them to abstain from the things polluted by idols, 
           and from sexual immorality, and from what has been strangled, and from blood.”"</a>(Acts 15)
           <br/><br/>
            Here the apostles explain that keeping laws of Moses, like circumcision dis not bring them salvation or keep them from defilement, but only 
           through Jesus Christ can a person be saved. And rather than keeping the laws concerning the outward condition of a person and what foods are consumed, Christians 
           are told to keep the commandments laid out in God's word which concern the heart's condition. And the Bible
           is clear that those who chose not to keep the commandments of the LORD concered with the heart and continue to sin
            after confessing Jesus as Lord will not be saved....

                  In the words of Jesus, <a id="verse">“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter 
                    the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is 
                    in heaven... many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy 
                    in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your
                     name?’ And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, 
                     you workers of lawlessness.’"</a>
